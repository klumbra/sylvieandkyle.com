"Mom (Nancy Lumbra)",1355367500,"My sister, Kyle's Aunt Pam, predicted early on, maybe 6 months into their relationship, that Kyle would be the first of his generation of cousins in our family to be married. Sometimes, two people just seem to belong with each other right away. He's a happy guy -- and we are so lucky, because our whole family has also fallen in love with Sylvie! We love you Kyle and Sylvie, and are so excited for your wedding and the start of your lives together."
